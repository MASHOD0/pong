    Pong Remake

    pong-12
    "The Resize Update"

    Originally programmed by Atari in 1972. Features two
    paddles, controlled by players, with the goal of getting
    the ball past your opponent's edge. First to 10 points wins.

    This version is built to more closely resemble the NES than
    the original Pong machines or the Atari 2600 in terms of
    resolution, though in widescreen (16:9) so it looks nicer on 
    modern systems.

-- methods
Class = require 'class'

-- our Paddle class, which stores position and dimensions for each Paddle

require 'Paddle'

-- our Ball class, which isn't much different than a Paddle structure-wise
-- but which will mechanically function very differently
require 'Ball'
