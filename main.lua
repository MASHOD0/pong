    "The Resize Update"

    Author: Colton Ogden
    cogden@cs50.harvard.edu

    Originally programmed by Atari in 1972. Features two
    paddles, controlled by players, with the goal of getting
    the ball past your opponent's edge. First to 10 points wins.

    This version is built to more closely resemble the NES than
    the original Pong machines or the Atari 2600 in terms of
    resolution, though in widescreen (16:9) so it looks nicer on 
    modern systems.
